# Episode 2: Boy Parts

### Introduction

The episode sheds light on how Delphine LaLaurie (Kathy Bates) managed to remain alive in the present day, it also reveals the fate of Marie Laveau (Angela Bassett). The character of Misty Day (Lily Rabe) is introduced a little more in-depth than from what was seen in the first episode. Angela Bassett and Gabourey Sidibe guest star as Marie Laveau and Queenie, respectively.

### Plot

Detective Sanchez and Stiles interrupt to talk to Madison and Zoe about the deaths of the fraternity brothers. Zoe cracks and reveals to the detectives that they're all witches. Cordelia and Fiona cover for her.

Zoe and Madison cast a resurrection spell in order to bring Kyle back to life. When Kyle reanimates as a scared, angry monster, Zoe must seek help from a reclusive Necromancer, Misty Day.

At a gynecology appointment, Cordelia gets bad news that her fertility drugs aren't working after a year of taking them. Dr. Morrison suggests in-vitro. Hank, her husband, asks if she wants to keep trying and asks her to use magic, but she doesn't want to become like her mother.

Still seeking to be perpetually young and beautiful, Fiona questions her new captive, Madame Delphine LaLaurie. Delphine tells Fiona that 180 years ago, a voodoo priestess named Marie Laveau gave her an immortality elixir, killed her family, and buried her alive. In hopes of becoming immortal as well, Fiona visits the still-living Laveau in a 9th Ward beauty salon and confides that she wants to know her secret to immortality. Marie mocks her and calls her muscle to toss Fiona out, so Fiona lights her racks of wigs on fire, promising she'll be back.
