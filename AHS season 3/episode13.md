# Episode 13 : Seven Wonders #

**Introduction**

*In the halls of Miss Robichaux's Academy, Stevie Nicks sings "Seven Wonders" while the individual candidates prepare in their own ways. They descend the staircase, each in a black dress and a shawl, and Stevie wishes them luck.Myrtle Snow prepares a "last supper" for the candidates. Cordelia explains that it is unprecedented for four candidates to attempt the Seven Wonders without sponsorship by the outgoing Supreme.*

*They begin with telekinesis. Kyle lights candles. Misty Day, Queenie, Madison, and Zoe move each candle in turn, with Misty displaying difficulty at first and Zoe barely taking a second to move the candle.* 

**Plot**

*Cordelia goes public about the Witches and their powers in a television interview, inviting new witches to the Academy. Files and a map show emerging witches nationwide. Cordelia wants Queenie and Zoe on the new Council. Myrtle describes the future and reminds Cordelia that she herself must pay for killing the other Council members, Quentin Fleming and Cecily Pembroke. Cordelia resists, saying that Myrtle has been like a true mother for her, but Myrtle insists that she once again should be burnt at the stake. Musically accompanied by "Silver Springs", Cordelia pronounces her sentence for Quentin and Cecily's deaths. Myrtle cries out "Balenciaga!" before Cordelia sets her ablaze.*
