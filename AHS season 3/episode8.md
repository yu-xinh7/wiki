**Plot**

*Queenie walks under a bridge at night in a bad part of town and a man approaches, attempting to rape her. She picks up a board with nails in it and punctures her own hand, making him bleed, then bludgeones him with it for good measure. Madison and Zoe find her and ask her to come back to the Academy with them. Queenie says Marie Laveau set her straight about them not being her true friends and that she is working for the voodoo now. Madison taunts her by pointing out that she herself stayed even after Fiona slit her throat, while Queenie ran away because she was feeling left out. Zoe tells her that a new Supreme is rising and Queenie mocks her, asking if Zoe thinks it is her, since Fiona had also lied and told Queenie it could be her. Queenie proceeds to extract the beating heart of the man, while Zoe and Madison look on in disgust. Queenie explains to the witches that Marie needs a dark heart to make a potion that will give Queenie more powers, and that this particular man had raped three school girls. She tells them that witchcraft and voodoo are too big to fit in New Orleans together, and that Zoe and Madison are both on the losing side of the upcoming war.*
