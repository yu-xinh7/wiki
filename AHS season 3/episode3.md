# Episode 3 : seven wonders #

*In the halls of Miss Robichaux's Academy, Stevie Nicks sings "Seven Wonders" while the individual candidates prepare in their own ways. They descend the staircase, each in a black dress and a shawl, and Stevie wishes them luck.Myrtle Snow prepares a "last supper" for the candidates. Cordelia explains that it is unprecedented for four candidates to attempt the Seven Wonders without sponsorship by the outgoing Supreme.

They begin with telekinesis. Kyle lights candles. Misty Day, Queenie, Madison, and Zoe move each candle in turn, with Misty displaying difficulty at first and Zoe barely taking a second to move the candle.*
