# Episode 4: Fearful Pranks Ensue

### Introduction
In this episode, the coven is visited by the Council of Witchcraft after they are notified of Madison (Emma Roberts)'s disappearance. 

### Plot 
Fiona kills Madison and orders her butler, Spaulding, to get rid of the body. Fiona hears noises coming from the greenhouse and discovers a half dead Queenie just as the Minotaur appears. Fiona hauls Queenie up to her room and wakes Cordelia. The two of them frantically try to save Queenie as she dies, but she is quickly resurrected by Fiona. Fiona leaves the room. After Queenie awakes, Delphine LaLaurie thanks her for saving her life.

As Marie Laveau works, a package arrives at the salon and she discovers the Minotaur's severed head (still alive) in the box. Furious, Marie prepares for the same voodoo ceremony she did in 1961.

Zoe goes to get Kyle some food and he escapes before she returns.

Hank is away at a hotel awaiting his mistress, Kaylee. After vigorous sex, he shoots her in the head without hesitation.

The Council of the Witchcraft arrives at the Academy to discuss the disappearance of Madison. They explain that they were summoned by the clairvoyant Nan. The Council interrogates Fiona, who denies her part in Madison's death while sneering and smiling. After, Myrtle loses her temper and acknowledges that she knows, but can't prove, Fiona killed Anna-Leigh and Madison. A deflated Myrtle demands to know what happened to Madison, and reminds Fiona that punishment for killing another witch is death by fire. Cordelia steps in to defend her mother and reveals that Madison had a heart murmur. After the Council leaves, Fiona and Cordelia head to the bar. Cordelia takes a bathroom break, but a hooded figure appears and throws acid in her face, severely injuring her.

Back at the Academy, Madame LaLaurie's resurrected daughters appear at the door. The dead surround the house and prepare for an attack as LaLaurie, Zoe, Queenie, Luke, and Nan cower inside.
