# Episode 5 : Burn, Witch, Burn!


### Introduction


*"Burn, Witch. Burn!" is the fifth episode of the third season of the anthology television series American Horror Story, which premiered on November 6, 2013, on the cable network FX.*

*This episode focuses on Fiona (Jessica Lange) exacting revenge on Myrtle Snow (Frances Conroy) after Cordelia (Sarah Paulson) is blinded.*


### Plot

*At the academy, the students fend off an attack by Madame LaLaurie's daughters, Marie Laveau, and their zombies.*

*At the bar, Fiona hears Cordelia scream from the attack and calls for an ambulance. In the hospital, after Dr. Wilson tells Fiona that they couldn't save Cordelia's eyesight, Fiona raids the pharmacy for pills. Fiona stumbles into a room where a woman has just given birth to a stillborn baby. Fiona brings the dead infant to the woman and, as Fiona brushes her hand over the baby, it starts to breathe. When Hank makes it to the hospital, Fiona leaves to give him 15 minutes with Cordelia before she throws him out. He takes Cordelia's hand, and she has vision of him having sex with Kaylee.*

*The Council returns and orders that Fiona abdicate her Supremacy. Fiona refuses and accuses Myrtle of the acid attack on Cordelia. Cecily and Quentin vote to "burn the witch". The Coven and the Council walk out to a quarry where Myrtle is roped to a stake and doused in gasoline. Fiona flicks her lit cigarette at Myrtle and her body goes up in flames, killing her. Back at the house, it is revealed Queenie dipped her hand in a glass of acid at a key moment during Fiona's interrogation, framing Myrtle. Fiona flatters Queenie, telling her she can help build her powers, maybe even to become the next Supreme.*

*At the quarry, Misty Day finds Myrtle's charred corpse and uses her powers of resurgence to bring her back to life.*
