# Episode 9: Head

### Introduction
In this episode, Fiona (Jessica Lange) looks to form an alliance with Marie Laveau (Angela Bassett) while Cordelia
(Sarah Paulson)'s attacker is revealed. Angela Bassett, Gabourey Sidibe, and Patti LuPone guest star as Marie Laveau,
Queenie, and Joan Ramsey, respectively. This episode is rated TV-MA (LSV).

### Plot
Fiona offers truce and alliance to Marie Laveau, suggesting both the Coven and voodoo witches are a target of witch hunters,
but Marie refuses, secretly working with the hunters herself. She orders to Queenie to burn Delphine's head, but Queenie
instead attempt to redeem Delphine by exposing her to human rights art.

Throwing a lunch for the Witches' Council, Myrtle poisons and murders Cecily and Quentin to avenge herself and extract their eyes,
using them to restore Cordelia's eyesight, seemingly at cost of Cordelia's visions.

Nan bonds with Luke's mother Joan by reading the comatose boy's mind, but upon revealing Joan murdered her unfaithful husband,
Joan shuns Nan away, and suffocates Luke with a pillow.

Hank, who was trained to be a witch hunter since childhood and married Cordelia to infiltrate the Coven, is urged by Marie and his
father Harrison Renard, head of a witch hunter organization, to carry out the eradication of witches as soon as possible. Failing to
reconnect with Cordelia, Hank decides to assassinate the voodoo witches, killing many of them. Before he murders Marie, Queenie uses
her wound transference ability and shoots herself, killing Hank and seemingly herself. Marie seeks refuge at Miss Robichaux's.
