*Fiona tries to persuade Queenie to take a chance at the trial of the Seven Wonders, seven advanced feats of magic a witch must master to ascend as the Supreme.

*Cordelia searches for the missing Misty Day, trying to evoke a vision to no avail, even upon touching Madison who, in an attempt to avoid her, develops the power of teleportation, one of the Seven Wonders.
